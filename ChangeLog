2007-09-16    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* tinohtmlparse.c (ce): bugfix: % sign removed from % escape (as
	this ususally is a percent escape) and blank added (it's too often
	in buggy URLs).

2007-02-12    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* tinohtmlparse.c (main): again fix for incomplete lines.  Now
	only single lines will be fed to ekhtml, in the hope that no more
	buffer overruns will show up again.

2006-06-16    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* tinohtmlabsurl.sh (Usage): added and option to send
	non-url-lines to somewhere else (preferably /dev/null).

2006-02-12    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* tinohtmlparse.c (cb_start): EKHTML does not parse HTML-entities
	in atrribute strings.  Added this into tinohtmlparse.
	(p_ent): added for HTML-entity parsing
	(cx, ce): added for HTML-entitiy parsing output
	(main): usage added

2005-02-06    <tino@firebird.03.softkill.net>

	* tinohtmlparse.c (main): Ugly hack added to only feed full lines
	to ekhtml, as else cb_data might be called with incomplete lines.
	This is not the right way to do it.  It shall buffer the last line
	in cb_data, and flush the data to stdout as soon something else
	comes up.  However this is fairly complicated.  This way is quick
	and dirty, however the line numbers might get mixed up (restart at
	0 suddenly).  I can live with it.
