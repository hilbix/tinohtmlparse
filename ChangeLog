	* tinohtmlparse.c (main): Ugly hack added to only feed full lines
	to ekhtml, as else cb_data might be called with incomplete lines.
	This is not the right way to do it.  It shall buffer the last line
	in cb_data, and flush the data to stdout as soon something else
	comes up.  However this is fairly complicated.  This way is quick
	and dirty, however the line numbers might get mixed up (restart at
	0 suddenly).  I can live with it.
